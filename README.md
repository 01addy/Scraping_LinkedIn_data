# Scraping_LinkedIn_data
A Python script to scrape LinkedIn profiles to gather the following information:  
1) Job titles of individuals who have graduated from IITs.
2) Their current companies and industries.

NOTE:- **It's important to clarify that scraping LinkedIn directly using Selenium is against LinkedInâ€™s Terms of Service. LinkedIn has various protections in place to prevent scraping, including CAPTCHA challenges, IP blocking, and legal enforcement.
This Python script is written assuming you've already obtained the necessary OAuth token from LinkedIn and have the required permissions to access user data.**
